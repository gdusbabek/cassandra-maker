h1. cassandra_maker.py

cassandra_maker.py is a python script that will generate cassandra configuration and startup scripts for multiple hosts.

h2. Usage

To create configurations for hosts 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 in the @foo@ directory, assuming @bar@ contains the Cassandra source, execute this command:
@cassandra_maker.py foo bar 1 2 3@

This will create the following configuration directories:
@foo/conf_1@
@foo/conf_2@
@foo/conf_3@

Each of those configuration directories will contain all the files you would normally see in @$CASSANDRA_HOME/conf@.

It will also create the following empty data, commit log and saved-cache directories:
@foo/data_1@
@foo/data_2@
@foo/data_3@

You should also see the relevant @in.sh@ include scripts and startup scripts in @foo@.  At this point your new cluster should be ready to spin up.

h3. Todo

* detect platform and write either a @.command@ or @.sh@ script for the startup file.
* specify entire hosts instead of integers.
